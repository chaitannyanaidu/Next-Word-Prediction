# Next-Word-Prediction

Developed a Next Word Prediction system using a Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (Bi-LSTM) model. 
The model was trained on large text corpora to predict the most likely next word given a sequence of words,
enhancing natural language processing capabilities.
Demonstrated proficiency in deep learning techniques and model deployment for text generation tasks.
